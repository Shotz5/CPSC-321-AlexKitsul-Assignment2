The relationship between niceness and priority is that niceness directly adjusts the priority in user space. The relationship for user-space is:
PRIORITY = NICE + 100
The scale works with priorities 0-99 being kernel priorities, and 100-139 being user-space priorities.
Top runs on a scale from -99 to 20, where -99 to -20 are kernel priorities, and -19 to 20 are user space priorities.
